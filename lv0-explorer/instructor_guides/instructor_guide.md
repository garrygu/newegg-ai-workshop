## Overview
This guide supports instructors teaching Session 1 of the YouthAI Workshop. It summarizes key concepts, provides scripts, pacing suggestions, visual aids, and hands-on activities designed for students ages 13–17 with no prior coding experience.

---

## 1. Learning Goals
By the end of Session 1, students should understand:
- What AI is and how it works (simple explanation)
- Neural networks (beginner-friendly version)
- Game AI & decision trees
- ChatGPT and large language models (LLMs)
- AI translation & context challenges
- Deepfakes & authenticity
- AI for Good brainstorming
- Ethics & responsibility in AI

---

## 2. Teaching Tips for Non‑Native English Instructors
- Use short, simple sentences.
- Let visuals do the heavy lifting.
- Engage students with questions and activities.
- Encourage curiosity—there are no wrong answers.
- Move quickly between explanation and hands‑on demos.

---

## 3. Session Flow (Recommended)
Total time: ~90 minutes

### 1) Intro: What Is AI? (10 min)
**Key Script:**  
“AI means computers doing smart tasks that usually need human thinking. AI learns from data the way we learn from experience.”

**Visuals:**  
- “What is AI?” slide  
- Everyday AI infographic  

**Quick Demo:**  
Ask students where they see AI: TikTok, YouTube, Maps, Face ID.

---

### 2) How AI Learns – Machine Learning (10 min)
**Analogy Script:**  
“A baby learns what a cat looks like by seeing many cat pictures. AI does the same thing.”

**Hands‑On:**  
Cat vs Dog guessing game (students act as classifiers).

---

### 3) Neural Networks – Cartoon Explanation (10 min)
**Key Script:**  
“A neural network is like layers of filters. One layer finds edges, the next finds shapes, the last finds features.”

**Visuals:**  
- 4‑step neural network infographic  
- Animated GIF (one layer at a time)

---

### 4) Game AI & Decision Trees (10 min)
**Script:**  
“Game AI uses a decision tree—like a flowchart. It asks: Is the player visible? Is the player close? Then chooses an action.”

**Hands‑On:**  
Students act out “You Are the Game Enemy” using printed cards.

**Visual:**  
- Cartoon decision tree diagram

---

### 5) ChatGPT & Large Language Models (10 min)
**Simple Script:**  
“ChatGPT predicts the next word, then the next word, and builds a full sentence.”

**Analogy:**  
“Like phone autocomplete—but supercharged.”

**Hands‑On:**  
Students try ChatGPT with fun prompts.

**Visual:**  
- Next‑word prediction animation  
- Word‑by‑word cartoon diagram  

---

### 6) AI Translation & Ambiguity (10 min)
**Ambiguous Sentence Demo:**  
“The man saw the dog with the telescope.”

Ask:  
- Who has the telescope?  
- How does AI decide?  

**Hands‑On:**  
Students translate between languages using DeepL.  
Then add context and compare results.

**Visual:**  
- “How AI Translation Works” infographic  
- Ambiguity explanation diagram

---

### 7) Deepfakes & Authenticity (10 min)
**Simple Script:**  
“A deepfake is a fake image/video made by AI that looks real.”

**Short GAN Explanation:**  
“Two AIs train together—one makes fakes, one tries to catch them.”

**Hands‑On:**  
Play “Which Face Is Real?” game.

**Discussion Questions:**  
- Why is it hard to tell?  
- How can deepfakes be harmful?  
- How can we stay safe?

**Visual:**  
- Deepfake detection infographic  

---

### 8) AI for Good Challenge (15 min)
**Purpose:**  
Show the positive side of AI creativity.

**Flow:**  
1. Students ask ChatGPT for ideas.  
2. They choose their favorite.  
3. Teams create a 1‑minute pitch.  
4. Present to class.

**Pitch Template:**  
- Problem  
- AI solution  
- Who it helps  
- Why it matters  

**Visual:**  
- “AI for Good” slide  
- Blank project template

---

### 9) Reflection (5 min)
**Ask Students:**  
1. What is AI?  
2. What surprised you today?  
3. What concerns do you have?  
4. How do you feel?  
5. What do you want to learn next?  
6. What responsibilities do we have with AI?

**Visual:**
