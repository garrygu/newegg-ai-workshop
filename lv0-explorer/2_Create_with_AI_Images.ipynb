    "### ✅ DO:\n",
    "- Be **specific** — \"orange cat\" is better than \"cat\"\n",

    "- Describe **feelings** — \"happy\", \"mysterious\", \"peaceful\"\n",
    "- Include **colors** — \"vibrant colors\", \"blue and purple\"\n",
    "- Mention **lighting** — \"sunny\", \"cinematic lighting\", \"glowing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ DON'T:\n",
    "- Write **too short** — \"cat\" won't give good results\n",
    "- Be **too vague** — \"a thing\" doesn't help\n",
    "- Forget **style** — AI needs to know the look you want\n",
