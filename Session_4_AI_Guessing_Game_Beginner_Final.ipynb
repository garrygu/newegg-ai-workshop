    "```\n",
    "- **`def`**: Creates a new function\n",
    "- **`show_ai_image_guess`**: Name of our image display function\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Creates a reusable function for showing AI-generated images\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Image Ideas List**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ideas = [\"a cute puppy\", \"a flying car\", \"a slice of pizza\", \"a smiling robot\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`ideas`**: List of image descriptions the AI can show\n",
    "- **Why this list**: Common, recognizable objects that players can relate to\n",
    "- **Expandable**: You can add more creative or specific image ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Random Image Selection**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chosen = random.choice(ideas)\n",
    "print(f\"🖼️ AI shows an image of {chosen}!\")\n",
    "return chosen\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`random.choice(ideas)`**: Randomly selects one image idea\n",
    "- **`print(f\"🖼️ AI shows an image of {chosen}!\")`**: Displays the selected image\n",
    "- **`return chosen`**: Returns the chosen image for use in other parts of the game\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Image Integration Works**\n",
    "1. **AI selects image**: Randomly picks from available image ideas\n",
    "2. **AI displays image**: Shows the image description to the player\n",
    "3. **Player reacts**: Player gives clues or reactions about the image\n",
    "4. **AI responds**: AI uses both image and player input to make guesses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why This Approach is Effective**\n",
    "- **Simple**: Easy to implement and understand\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Can be easily expanded with more images\n",
    "- **Engaging**: Visual elements make the game more interesting\n",
    "- **Scalable**: Can be upgraded to show actual images later\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Game Examples**\n",
    "- **Educational Games**: Show images to help students learn\n",
    "- **Puzzle Games**: Use images as clues or challenges\n",
    "- **Story Games**: Display images to enhance narrative\n",
    "- **Quiz Games**: Show images for players to identify\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Future Enhancements**\n",
    "- **Actual Images**: Use image generation to create real images\n",
    "- **Image Classification**: Let AI identify what's in player-provided images\n",
    "- **Dynamic Images**: Generate images based on player preferences\n",
    "- **Image Reactions**: Analyze player reactions to specific images\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Analogy**\n",
    "Think of it like a picture book:\n",
    "- **Book**: The game system (displays images)\n",
    "- **Pictures**: The image ideas (visual content)\n",
    "- **Reader**: The player (reacts to images)\n",
    "- **Story**: The game experience (interactive and engaging)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Impact**: This adds visual appeal and makes our game more engaging and professional! 🚀\n",
