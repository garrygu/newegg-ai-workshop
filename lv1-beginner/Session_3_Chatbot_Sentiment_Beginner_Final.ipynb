    "## 🎯 How Sentiment Analysis Works\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is like teaching a computer to understand emotions in text! Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 1. Text Input\n",
    "- You give the AI text messages, reviews, or comments\n",
    "- The AI reads the words and looks for emotional clues\n",
    "- It analyzes patterns like word choice, punctuation, and context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 2. Emotion Detection\n",
    "- The AI tries to identify the emotional tone (happy, sad, angry, neutral)\n",
    "- It looks for positive words like \"love\", \"great\", \"amazing\"\n",
    "- It also finds negative words like \"hate\", \"terrible\", \"awful\"\n",
    "- It considers context and sentence structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 3. Sentiment Classification\n",
    "- The AI outputs a sentiment label: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL\n",
    "- It also provides a confidence score (how sure it is)\n",
    "- Higher confidence means the AI is more certain about its decision\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 Why This is Amazing\n",
    "- **Customer Service**: Companies can understand customer feedback automatically\n",
    "- **Social Media**: Track public opinion on products or events\n",
    "- **Mental Health**: Detect signs of depression or anxiety in text\n",
    "- **Content Moderation**: Automatically flag harmful or inappropriate content\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Examples**: Amazon reviews analysis, Twitter sentiment tracking, customer support chatbots, mental health monitoring apps! 🚀\n"

    "```python\n",

    "- **`score`**: Confidence level (0.9998 = 99.98% confident)\n",
    "- **Why useful**: Higher scores mean the AI is more certain\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Transformers Work**\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: Breaks text into individual words/tokens\n",
    "2. **Embedding**: Converts words to numbers the AI can understand\n",
    "3. **Attention**: Focuses on important words and their relationships\n",
    "4. **Classification**: Determines overall sentiment\n",

    "1. **User types**: \"I'm having a great day!\"\n",
    "2. **AI analyzes**: Detects POSITIVE sentiment\n",
    "3. **Chatbot responds**: \"😊 I'm glad to hear that! What made you feel this way?\"\n",
    "4. **Result**: User gets an appropriate, empathetic response\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why This is Effective**\n",
    "- **Empathetic**: Responds appropriately to user emotions\n",
    "- **Engaging**: Asks follow-up questions to continue conversation\n",
    "- **Visual**: Uses emojis to make responses more human-like\n",
    "- **Contextual**: Different responses for different emotions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Applications**\n",
    "- **Customer Service**: Respond appropriately to customer complaints or praise\n",
    "- **Mental Health**: Provide emotional support and encouragement\n",
    "- **Education**: Adapt teaching style based on student emotions\n",
    "- **Gaming**: Make NPCs respond realistically to player emotions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Testing the Chatbot**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(chatbot_response(\"I'm having a great day!\"))\n",
    "print(chatbot_response(\"I hate homework.\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **First test**: Positive message → Happy response\n",
    "- **Second test**: Negative message → Empathetic response\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Verify the chatbot works correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Analogy**\n",
    "Think of it like a good friend:\n",
    "- **Good friend**: Listens to your emotions and responds appropriately\n",
    "- **Bad friend**: Ignores your feelings or responds inappropriately\n",
    "- **Our chatbot**: Like a good friend who always responds with empathy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Impact**: This creates a chatbot that understands and responds to human emotions! 🚀\n",

    "<summary><strong>🧠 What does this hybrid approach do? (Click to Expand)</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the hybrid sentiment chatbot step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Function Definition**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hybrid_sentiment_chatbot(user_input):\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`def`**: Creates a new function\n",
    "- **`hybrid_sentiment_chatbot`**: Name of our advanced chatbot function\n",
    "- **`user_input`**: The message the user typed\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Creates a chatbot that uses both AI and rule-based methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **AI Analysis with Confidence Check**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ai_result = sentiment_model(user_input)[0]\n",
    "if ai_result['score'] < 0.8:\n",
    "    sentiment = rule_based_sentiment(user_input)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    sentiment = ai_result['label'].lower()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`ai_result['score']`**: Gets the AI's confidence level (0.0 to 1.0)\n",
    "- **`< 0.8`**: If AI is less than 80% confident\n",
    "- **`rule_based_sentiment(user_input)`**: Use the simple keyword method as backup\n",
    "- **`ai_result['label'].lower()`**: Use AI result if confident enough\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Use Confidence Scores?**\n",
    "- **High confidence (0.8+)**: AI is very sure about its analysis\n",
    "- **Low confidence (<0.8)**: AI is uncertain, so we use rule-based backup\n",
    "- **Why this matters**: Prevents the AI from making wrong decisions when uncertain\n",
    "- **Real-world example**: Like asking a second opinion when the first doctor isn't sure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Response Logic**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 'pos' in sentiment:\n",
    "    return \"🌞 You sound happy today! Keep it up!\"\n",
    "elif 'neg' in sentiment:\n",
    "    return \"🌧️ Sounds like something's bothering you. Hope it gets better.\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    return \"🌤️ Hmm, I can't tell — maybe you're feeling okay?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`'pos' in sentiment`**: Checks if sentiment contains \"positive\" or \"pos\"\n",
    "- **`'neg' in sentiment`**: Checks if sentiment contains \"negative\" or \"neg\"\n",
    "- **`else`**: Handles neutral or unclear cases\n",
    "- **Different emojis**: Visual representation of different emotions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How the Hybrid Approach Works**\n",
    "1. **User types**: \"This workshop is awesome!\"\n",
    "2. **AI analyzes**: Detects POSITIVE with 95% confidence\n",
    "3. **Since 95% > 80%**: Use AI result\n",
    "4. **Chatbot responds**: \"🌞 You sound happy today! Keep it up!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When Rule-Based Backup is Used**\n",
    "1. **User types**: \"I'm not sure how I feel\"\n",
    "2. **AI analyzes**: Detects NEUTRAL with 60% confidence\n",
    "3. **Since 60% < 80%**: Use rule-based method\n",
    "4. **Rule-based**: No positive/negative words found → \"neutral\"\n",
    "5. **Chatbot responds**: \"🌤️ Hmm, I can't tell — maybe you're feeling okay?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why This Hybrid Approach is Better**\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Always has a backup method\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Uses AI when confident, simple rules when uncertain\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Handles edge cases better than either method alone\n",
    "- **Real-world**: This is how professional systems work\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Analogy**\n",
    "Think of it like a medical diagnosis:\n",
    "- **Primary doctor**: AI model (expert but sometimes uncertain)\n",
    "- **Second opinion**: Rule-based method (simple but reliable)\n",
    "- **Decision**: Use primary doctor when confident, second opinion when uncertain\n",
    "- **Result**: More reliable overall diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Performance Benefits**\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Combines strengths of both methods\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Always provides some answer\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Uses simple method when AI is uncertain\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Handles unusual or ambiguous text better\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Impact**: This creates a more reliable and robust sentiment analysis system! 🚀\n",
