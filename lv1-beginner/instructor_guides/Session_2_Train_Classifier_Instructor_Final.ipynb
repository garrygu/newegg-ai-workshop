    "- Change the number of filters (e.g., from 6 to 8)  \n",

    "# 💡 Instructor Guidance & Enrichment Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧭 Session Overview\n",
    "Students will learn to train an image classifier using PyTorch and the CIFAR‑10 dataset.  \n",
    "Encourage curiosity and creativity — focus on **how machines learn patterns** rather than coding perfection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 🧩 Section-by-Section Instructor Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Step 1 – Setup\n",
    "💡 **Tip:** If internet speed is slow, pre‑download the CIFAR‑10 dataset and store it locally on workshop machines.  \n",
    "⚠️ **Common Issue:** Students may run into `RuntimeError: CUDA not available`. Encourage them to switch to CPU mode — training will be slower but fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🖼️ Step 2 – Explore the Dataset\n",
    "🌍 **Real‑World Example:** Explain that image classification is the foundation for technologies like **Google Photos’ search** (“show me cats”) or **self‑driving car vision systems**.  \n",
    "🎉 **Fun Idea:** Let students vote which class (e.g., cat vs. dog) they think the AI will confuse most!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🧩 Step 3 – Build the Neural Network\n",
    "💡 **Tip:** Use the analogy of the **human brain** — convolutional layers act like *eyes* detecting shapes and edges, while fully connected layers are the *decision-makers*.  \n",
    "⚠️ **Common Issue:** If students modify the number of layers or neurons, remind them to adjust the linear layer input size accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🚀 Step 5 – Train the Model\n",
    "💡 **Tip:** Encourage students to notice the *loss decreasing*. That’s like the AI “getting better at learning.”  \n",
    "🌍 **Real‑World Connection:** Talk about **how AI models are trained on massive image datasets** (e.g., ImageNet) and how this small CIFAR‑10 example is a simplified version of real‑world AI training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🔍 Step 6 – Evaluate Performance\n",
    "🎉 **Fun Activity:** Have students compare their test accuracy. Make a leaderboard!  \n",
    "💡 **Tip:** Discuss **overfitting** in simple terms: when an AI memorizes instead of generalizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 🧪 Step 8 – Try Your Own Image\n",
    "🌍 **Example:** Explain how phone apps like Snapchat filters or Amazon product scanners work using similar classification logic.  \n",
    "💡 **Tip:** If bandwidth allows, let students bring an image of a real object and see what the AI thinks!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 🏆 Challenge Solutions & Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ 🧠 Train Longer\n",
    "✅ **Answer:** Accuracy usually improves slightly (e.g., from 55% → 60%) with more epochs, but overfitting may appear after 10+.  \n",
    "💬 *Teaching Point:* More training ≠ always better — balance is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ 🎨 Modify the Model\n",
    "✅ **Example:** Adding another conv layer (`nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3)`) can boost accuracy, but increases training time.  \n",
    "💬 *Teaching Point:* More layers help the model “see” more complex features, but make sure the dataset is large enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ ⚙️ Tune Parameters\n",
    "✅ **Example:** Smaller learning rate (e.g., 0.0005) → slower learning but more stable.  \n",
    "Larger rate (e.g., 0.01) → faster but may overshoot.  \n",
    "💬 *Teaching Point:* Hyperparameter tuning is like “finding the sweet spot” — there’s no single correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ 📸 Use Your Own Images\n",
    "✅ **Solution:** Convert custom images to 32×32 pixels, normalize, then test. Some images may give funny or wrong results — that’s normal!  \n",
    "💬 *Teaching Point:* Discuss why context matters — the AI only learned from 10 object categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ 🚀 Bonus Challenge – CIFAR‑100\n",
    "✅ **Answer:** The same code works with `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR100`. Accuracy will drop significantly (~20%) since it’s a much harder task.  \n",
    "💬 *Teaching Point:* Real‑world AI often faces “CIFAR‑100 problems” — vast diversity, limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 🎓 Wrap-Up\n",
    "🎯 Reinforce key ideas:\n",
    "- AI “learns from examples.”  \n",
    "- Model performance depends on **data quality + architecture + tuning.**  \n",
    "- Encourage exploration — that’s how great data scientists start!\n",
    "\n",
    "🎉 **Fun Closing Idea:** Have students describe one real-world product that likely uses image classification (e.g., Tesla Autopilot, TikTok filters, airport scanners).  \n"
